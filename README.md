This is the repository for Knifesurge's Pokedex-like application.

Please note that there is no GUI version at the moment, so this can only be run on the command line.

This app makes it easy for players to find their favorite Pokemon by searching for the ID, name(coming soon), and even find multiple 
of the same type (also coming soon)!

Since this project is in the very early stages of development, expect the program to have some bugs and errors.

As of September 4, 2016, this project is a work in progress and is not fully runnable yet. Please, sit back, relax, and wait for 
Knifesurge to finish the application to a decent running program.

Check this page out every so often to see how the project is going!
